# PythonEEG

**Analyzes .BIN files generated by companion Matlab code, and generates figures.**

Linux and Mac are supported (Python 3.10). Windows was supported in an earlier version but is untested.

## Setup (for developing)

- Install Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater (to get SpikeInterface to work)
  - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
  - Minimal install required, Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 should be sufficient
- Have Python installed
  - https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Set up the Python environment
  - Create environment: `python -m venv .venv-win`
  - Activate environment: `.venv-win\Scripts\activate`
    - Check that `where python` returns the .venv-win environment first
  - Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements-win.txt`
- Install VSCode, or other appropriate development software
  - https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Program is in `pythoneeg.ipynb`. Set the notebook kernel to `.venv-win`
